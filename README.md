# AutoLights
A C# program to control LimtlessLED lights (and later music) automatically. Currently only supports a vacation mode at this time.

I was created this program so that I could easily manage both lights and music in my house using events and schedules in (I believe) 2014. At this time, it is able to turn the lights on and off at pseudo random intervals to simulate homeowners being around while they are on vacation (as this was my immediate use case for the program). I have since abanded the project, but it provides quite an easy to implemment API that is fairly extensisible and reliable.
